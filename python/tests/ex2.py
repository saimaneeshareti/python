'''
   Write a function to take a list argument. Find the element that has greatest length.
    Example :
        listA=["hello","world","science","maths","Python"]
        result=func_exec(listA)
        print(result)
        Expected Output : ["science"]
        Reason: length of science -> 7
    Example :
        listA=["hello","world","science","maths","Pythonics"]
        result=func_exec(listA)
        print(result)
        Expected Output : ["Pythonics"]
        Reason: length of Pythonics -> 9

    solution steps:
    ***************
    Iterate the list
    Calculate the length of each element in the list
    Find the element that has greatest length
    Return the Element
