# Aim :
  Use SSH to Connect a Docker Container

STEPS:
  STEP1 : 
   - Create SSH Key Pair :
      # Generate the SSH key on the Ubuntu system
      # Before creating the SSH key, ensure that you don’t already have the SSH key on your ubuntu vm.
      # Sometimes you already have an SSH key pair on your Ubuntu system.Therefore when you create a new key pair it will be 
        overwritten on the old one.
      # To verify that either the SSH key file exists on your client machine or not
        ls -l ~/.ssh/id.pub 

  STEP2 : 
   - Generate new SSH key pair :
      # When we run the above command you will receive an error saying “No such file or directory” then,
        it means you don’t have an SSH key on your machine.
      # Generate the SSH key pair on the Ubuntu client machine.
       ssh-keygen  

      # If you run the above command “ssh-keygen”, it generates a default  key pair. To save the SSH key on the default location.
      # To check the ssh key pair is successfully generated on the Ubuntu machine.
        ls ~/.ssh/id

  STEP3 : 
    - Build the docker image :
      # Once create the SSH key pair, Next create a new directory name "sshdemo" and create a Dockerfile.
      # We can now build ubuntu docker image from the Dockerfile with the command
         docker build -t sshubuntu

      # In docker file i'm using ubuntu as the base image for the container
      # Above command compiles a new docker image called “sshubuntu” based on the script inside the Dockerfile.
      # The above command will take some time to complete because we’ve instructed in the Dockerfile to install the openssh-server package and run a few extra commands to set the root password and enable root SSH login.
      # After install the OpenSSH server, add a new user name "sshuser"
      # copies the SSH public key file to the authorized_keys file in the container, 
         starts the SSH service using systemctl

      # The container listens on port 22 which is the default for ssh and finally runs the SSH daemon
      

  STEP4 : 
    - Running the Docker container :
      # Docker image just created name “sshubuntu”.We also map docker port 22 to host port 2022.  
         docker run -d -p 2022:22 sshubuntu

      # Our docker container is now running host port 2022
         To verify you can use the docker ps 

  STEP5 :
   - SSH into the Docker container :
   # From here, you can initiate an SSH connection into the running container.
       ssh -i idkey sshuser@localhost -p 2022

   # Above command connects to docker's default IP address but localhost can be different if you explicitly specify the          container's IP address.

  FROM ubuntu:latest
  RUN apt update && apt install -server sudo -y

  # Create a user “sshuser” and group “sshgroup”
  RUN groupadd sshgroup && useradd -ms /bin/bash -g sshgroup sshuser

  # Create sshuser directory in home
  RUN mkdir -p /home/sshuser/.ssh

  # Copy the ssh public key in the authorized_keys file. The idkey.pub below is a public key file you get from ssh-keygen. They are under ~/.ssh directory by default.
  COPY idkey.pub /home/sshuser/.ssh/authorized_keys

  # change ownership of the key file. 
  RUN chown sshuser:sshgroup /home/sshuser/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 /home/sshuser/.ssh/authorized_keys

  # Start SSH service
  RUN service ssh start

  # Expose docker port 22
  EXPOSE 22
